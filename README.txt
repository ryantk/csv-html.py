    ABOUT
    =====

This script was written for a University assignment, it is written in Python 3.
The script is on github mainly to let me get to grips with using the github
system (uploading etc).
	

	IMPORTANT
	=========

- The program is custom made to parse Government data, so variable names are
  written to reflect the formatting of the Government spreadsheet.

- Assumes .csv has no header row

- Could be adapted to parse any .csv file.


  How to use the program
==========================

To run csv2html either type "python csv2html.py" or run in pyscripter.
Supply the argument "-h" for full help and argument listings.

results1.html and results2.html are sample data from running the
program from command line with arguments "-cri 7" (to sort by amount sterling)
and "-cols 2,3,7" (to show only date of payment, expense type and amount sterling)
"-o results" (to name the html page results) and "-i data.csv" to input my test data 
data.csv.
